# Battery Case
Various sizes and configurations of 3D printable battery cases.

## Work in progress
As of yet I have only designed a few configurations and only for AAA batteries. There will at least be a few more for AA batteries when I get the time.

## Making your own battery cases

I get the battery springs from Ali Express but anyone with the same measures will do. You are of course free to change the models or use them in any other project if you need to as long as you follow the LICENSE and give credit.
