# Battery Case
Various sizes and configurations of 3D printable battery cases.

## Prerequisites
You will need battery springs and connectors that can fit in the finished 3D printed case. The ones here where designed with these in mind:
- For AAA batteries: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000398396436.html

You are also required to solder the connector to the first and last spring - without soldering the quality might not be good enough.

## Work in progress
As of yet I have only designed a few configurations and only for AAA batteries. There will at least be a few more for AA batteries when I get the time.

## Making your own battery cases

I get the battery springs from Ali Express but anyone with the same measures will do. You are of course free to change the models or use them in any other project if you need to as long as you follow the LICENSE and give credit.
